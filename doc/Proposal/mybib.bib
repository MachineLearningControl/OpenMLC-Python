abstract = {This book is an introduction to machine learning control (MLC), a surprisingly sim- ple model-free methodology to tame complex nonlinear systems. These systems are assumed to be manipulated by a finite number of actuators (inputs) and monitored by a finite number of sensors (outputs). The control logic is chosen to minimize a well-defined cost functional.},

@book{Ogata2002,
abstract = {A comprehensive introduction to control system analysis for mechanical and electrical engineers. Praised for its clarity of writing, the new edition has been totally revamped with an eye toward practical application, and includes a section on the use of MATLAB, and more case studies. Control Engineering contains three new chapters - on control system hardware, discrete time systems, and microprocessor based control - and the chapter on z-transform has been rewritten.},
